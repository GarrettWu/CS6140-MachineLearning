CS6140 Assignment1 Guanglei Wu

The assignment written in Java 1.8.0_25, tested compiled and run on Eclipse Oxygen2.
Only standard libraries are used, no special includes.

Please unzip the compression and put the data files and src directory into the home directory of a java project. 
Which is the correct path of the data files. Otherwise need to specify file paths in Data classes.

Run each Problem1, 2 6 files to get the print result.
For spam, it runs slow, so if definitely want to run them, uncomment the test code first.

Problem1: Continuous*.java files and Problem1.java
Problem2: Discrete*.java files and Problem2.java
Problem6: Regression*.java files and Problem6.java

Util.java: utility functions
